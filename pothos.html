            <h3>Description:</h3>
                <p>Pothos is arguably one of the easiest houseplants to grow, even if you're someone who forgets to water your plants often enough. This trailing vine, native to the Solomon Islands in the South Pacific, has pointed, heart-shaped green leaves that are sometimes variegated with white, yellow, or pale green striations. Pothos can be planted indoors throughout the entire year and will grow quickly, often adding between 12 to 18 inches of length in a month. <em>Be aware that this plant is toxic to pets.</em></p>
            <h3>Care instructions:</h3>
                <h4>Sunlight</h4>
                <p>When grown indoors, pothos prefers bright but indirect light. Variegated plants sometimes lose their leaf pattern and revert to all-green foliage if they don't receive enough ligt. Moving them to brighter conditions usually restores the variegation. Suddenly pale-looking leaves mean the plant is receiving too much sun.</p>
                <p>While pothos likes bright, indirect light, it can also thrive in low light areas or those that have only have fluorescent lighting, making it an excellent option for offices and dorm rooms. </p>
                <h4>Water</h4>
                <p>A pothos plant likes to have its soil dry out completely between waterings. If left in continually damp soil, the plant's roots will rot. Black spots on the leaves (or the sudden collapse of the plant) indicate that the soil has been kept too wet. The plant will indicate when it needs water. When it starts to droop, it needs water. However, donâ€™t wait until the leaves start to shrivel or the plant will lose some leaves. Dry, brown edges mean the plant was kept dry for too long. </p>
