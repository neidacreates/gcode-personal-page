        <h3>Description:</h3>
            <p>Peace lilies are tropical species and hybrid from the Spathiphyllum genus that are a favorite flowering houseplant. A striking plant when used in mass display, the peace lily blooms in spring with long-lasting flower stalks that hover gracefully over the foliage. The plant has glossy oval leaves with points that emerge from the soil. A well-grown peace lily may bloom twice a year, resulting in several months of flowers. </p>
        <h3>Care instructions:</h3>
            <h4>Sunlight</h4>
                <p>Peace lilies are shade-loving plants in their native habitats, but when grown indoors they need a bit more filtered light, though not direct sunlight (some varieties can withstand more light than others). Curled, pale leaves generally indicate that the plant is receiving too much light and scorched leaves indicate too much direct sun. In either case, the plant should be moved to a shadier location. </p>
            <h4>Water</h4>
                <p>Peace lilies much prefer being underwatered rather than overwatered, so take care to water them only when they're dry at least an inch below the surface. During the summer, mist peace lilies frequently because they thrive with higher humidity like is typical in a rainforest. In winter, reduce watering but never allow the soil to dry out completely. If your water at home is highly chlorinated, it's a good idea to use filtered water. Alternatively, you can allow tap water to sit for several days until the chlorine evaporates out.  </p>
