        <h3>Description:</h3>
            <p><em>Dracaena trifasciata</em>, commonly known as the snake plant, is one of the most popular and hardy species of houseplants. The plant features stiff, sword-like leaves and can range anywhere from six inches to eight feet tall. Snake plants can vary in color although many have green-banded leaves and commonly feature a yellow border. These plants are easy to grow and, in many cases, are nearly indestructible. </p>
        <h3>Care instructions:</h3>
            <h4>Sunlight</h4>
                <p>Snake plants prefer indirect but steady light with some direct sun. They can adapt to full sun conditions and will also survive dimly lit situations. </p>
                <p>They will thrive in very bright light or almost dark corners of the house. Snake plants generally grow slowly in indoor light, but increasing its exposure to light will boost growth if it receives a few hours of direct sun.</p>
            <h4>Water</h4>
                <p> Let the soil dry between waterings. During the winter, reduce watering to monthly, or whenever the soil is dry to the touch. Err on the side of under-watering; too much water can harm the plant.   </p>
